# PowerElectronics_wSimulink
 This is a project where I put together the simulations of the circuits I learned about in my "Power Electronic Circuits" course using Simulink. Some important values such as input/output voltage and current are connected to the scope to 
illustrate the waveforms. At some of the circuits, the mean and RMS values are also displayed. Frewheeling diodes and capacitors are added in rectifiers but not connected.
